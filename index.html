			The mission of the Waterloo Regional Block Parent Program is to provide a network of safe homes and businesses for children and other members of the community to turn to in times of need, and to offer supportive Community Education Programs.

			<br><br> A Block Parent is an adult volunteer who has been Police and Block Parent screened, has been trained, and who has received a registered Block Parent Sign. The Block Parent sign is placed in a front facing window of the Block Parent home. The sign indicates that an adult is available to answer the door to a child, or any community member, who needs assistance. The Block Parent can offer assistance by calling a parent, family member or emergency service. The Block Parent sign shows the community that a caring adult is available, that children are encouraged to visit the Block Parent home if they need assistance, and acts as a deterrent to possible crime in the neighbourhood.
