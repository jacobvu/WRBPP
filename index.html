			<h2> MISSION </h2>
				<p>
				The mission of the Waterloo Regional Block Parent Program is to provide a network of safe homes and businesses for children and other members of the community to turn to in times of need, and to offer supportive Community Education Programs.
				</p>

		<div class = "cm-cols">
			<h2> WHO WE ARE</h2>
			<p>
			A Block Parent is an adult volunteer who has been Police and Block Parent screened, has been trained, and who has received a registered Block Parent Sign. The Block Parent sign is placed in a front facing window of the Block Parent home. The sign indicates that an adult is available to answer the door to a child, or any community member, who needs assistance. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "cm-cols">
			<h2> WHAT WE DO</h2>
			<p>
			The Block Parent can offer assistance by calling a parent, family member or emergency service. The Block Parent sign shows the community that a caring adult is available, that children are encouraged to visit the Block Parent home if they need assistance, and acts as a deterrent to possible crime in the neighbourhood.
